# DreamTree Protocol — Parameters

*The canonical source of truth for every tunable lever in the protocol. Started 2026-05-22.*

*Companion to [`protocol-spec.md`](./protocol-spec.md). The spec describes what each lever **does**; this document holds what each lever **is** (canonical name) and **currently holds** (stand-in value). When the spec and this document disagree on a value, this document wins. When the protocol is built, the canonical block below lifts directly into a config file / on-chain parameter registry.*

---

## The abstraction

Every numeric value in the protocol is a named variable, not a hardcoded constant (see protocol-spec heuristic #7). Three reasons this pays dividends:

1. **One place to change.** A lever moves here; everywhere that references it updates at once.
2. **Governance operates on names.** When parameter-setting moves from founder to community vote, the ballot is "set `reputation.neg_asymmetry` to X" — a named, bounded, auditable change.
3. **Machine-readable path.** The canonical block is valid YAML. It becomes the protocol's config at build time and an on-chain parameter registry at v2+.

**Stand-in values** are placeholders chosen so the system runs. They are not claims about the right value. `null` means "lever identified, value not yet chosen."

**Disposition** codes:
- `settled` — the concept is decided; the value may still tune, but the shape won't change
- `governance` — founder-set at v0, moves to community vote as governance matures
- `founder→governance` — same, explicitly flagged as a launch-bootstrap parameter
- `per-domain` — set per node in the domain taxonomy, not globally

## Invariants (fixed, never tunable)

- **`creator_equality_within_type`** — `p(c1,s,a) = p(c2,s,a) = p(c3,s,a)`. Within a data type, every creator is priced identically. The market discovers value *across* types at the margin; the protocol guarantees equality *across creators* of the same type. The protocol never prices the person. (This replaces the earlier global "1 seed = 1 photon" rule — value is now marginal and market-set per type; what survives is creator-equality-within-type.)
- **`photons = seeds`** — the photon supply is pegged 1:1 to the seed count. One photon mints per seed recorded (to the storer-validators of that seed). No halving schedule, no inflation curve; supply tracks the corpus. Not a tunable parameter — it's the monetary-policy invariant.

---

## Not parameters

Some values that look like levers are deliberately **not** in this registry:

- **Per-type data prices (`N_a`).** Market outcomes — supply and demand set what access to a data type costs, in photons. The protocol injects verified information so the market prices accurately (heuristic #8), but never sets the price. Never appears here.
- **Producer compensation.** Equals volume × `N_a` — how many of a creator's seeds sell, at their type's market price. A market outcome, not a parameter. Never appears here.
- **Domain taxonomy contents.** The taxonomy (which classes/fields/disciplines/specialties exist) is a governance-maintained dataset, not a numeric lever. Seeded at v0 from LCC + ISCED + ONET/ISCO-08.
- **The pre-population unsigned discount** — currently lives in protocol-spec §Identity; should be promoted here as a lever once its shape firms up. Flagged for migration.

## Change log

- **2026-05-22 — v0.1.0.** Initial registry. 26 parameters extracted from protocol-spec §Levers and §Reputation Dynamics. Two settled (`reputation.lambda_r_target`, `decay.proof_origin`); five `null` pending design (lambda_r_base, saturation_point, outcome_magnitude, s_max, coldstart.*); rest are governance-evolved stand-ins.
- **2026-05-22 — v0.2.0.** Two-token model (Photons + Seeds). Added `economics.access_duration_days` and `economics.photon_issuance`. Added the first **invariant**: `seed_access_per_photon = 1` (fixed, not a lever). Renamed the "not a parameter" entry from contributor-compensation-rate to producer-compensation-rate and clarified it's volume-driven (1 P/seed fixed). `economics.marketplace_toll` flagged unreconciled (worked example ~10% vs. earlier 1–2%).
- **2026-05-22 — v0.3.0.** Per-type market pricing adopted (data value is marginal; market sets price per type). Invariant **changed** from `seed_access_per_photon = 1` to `creator_equality_within_type` (`p(c1,s,a)=p(c2,s,a)=p(c3,s,a)`) — global uniform price gone; creator-equality-within-type survives. Added per-type data prices (`N_a`) to "not parameters" (market outcome). Producer compensation restated as volume × `N_a`.
- **2026-05-22 — v0.4.0.** Monetary policy resolved: **`photons = seeds`** invariant (supply pegged 1:1 to corpus). Two minting streams — S to creators (participation), P to storer-validators (storage + validation). `economics.photon_issuance` removed as a free parameter (determined by the peg). Added `economics.storage_replication_factor` and `economics.block_cadence_seconds`. Data lives in wallets (wallet-indexed fabric); unified validator-storer participation spectrum.
- **2026-05-22 — v0.5.0.** `marketplace_toll` reconciled to **5%**. `access_duration_days` set to **1**. Storage rewards resolved: one-time ingestion mint (peg-preserving) + ongoing rent from circulating photons (access cuts + treasury subsidy), never new emission — added `economics.access_cut_to_storers`. Open: ingestion-photon split among storers, access-cut value.
- **2026-06-24 — v0.6.0.** Outcome magnitude `M_O` resolved (formula + 5 clarifications, see `protocol-spec.md` §Reputation Dynamics). Replaced `reputation.outcome_magnitude: null` with `reputation.outcome_magnitude_beta: 1.0` and `reputation.outcome_magnitude_cap_multiplier: 5`. Uses `S(att, t_issuance)` (not current); multiple reporters aggregate paper-shape; self-reports cred ≈ 0; outcomes are attestations of `dt.outcome.*`; outcome refutation reverses + 2× penalty.
- **2026-06-24 — v0.7.0.** Saturation point resolved (two-piece linear + log dampening). Replaced `reputation.saturation_point: null` with per-domain tiered structure: `small=5`, `standard=10`, `large=50` (each domain node tagged with a tier; v0 default `standard`). Added global `reputation.dampening_k: 5`. Per-domain from day zero (mirrors `domain.obsolescence_multiplier`), not deferred to v1+.
